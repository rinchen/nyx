## External proposal triage (2026-09)

Ideas from an external list that **collide with closed ticket IDs**. Status vs this tree:

| Proposal idea | Verdict |
|---------------|---------|
| S8 interleaved rANS after SIMD walk_dist | **Done** — already wired in `bytecodec` |
| S9 libsais BWT | **Done** — `bwt_libsais` → `libsais-rs` (default still `divsufsort` O(n)) |
| S10 prefetch + stretch-in-`MixerAcc` | **Done as S11** — stretch LUT on `MixerAcc`; `_mm_prefetch` next bank |
| S11 bumpalo / per-block bank arena | **Rejected** — banks are flat SoA + decay in place, not 8192 `Vec`s/block |
| S12 parallel BWT trials | **Done as S12** — `parallel_map_sizes` covers RawCm / XWRT / JSON / CSV / XML trials |
| C6 XWRT-512 ESC | **Done** |
| C7 classifier DP thresholds | **Done** (Text 12; Binary/Exec 16 — ≥24 hurt mr) |
| C8 16k + Indirect default | **Banks done; Indirect shelved** |
| C9 Order-12 PPMd Text | **Tried as C10 — reverted** (gain ≪ 0.3pt) |
| C10 FSE side-stream | **Done** (repo C9) |
| C11 CSV/XML stream split | **Done as C11** — detectors + BWT trial wiring; fixture A/B kept |

## Current Stack (What Works)

### Hybrid Path (`--mode hybrid`, default)

- Text/Random → Fast byte CM (global XWRT-1024 trials + DP-LZP side-stream);
  Fast Text/Random blocks encoded in parallel (W3)
- Binary/Exec → Slow bit CM + DP-LZP + E8E9 on Exec; 1 MiB blocks + match hist (W1)
- Clears headline set vs `zstd -19` (2026-09-11 W1–W7 measure)

### Slow Path (`--mode slow`)

- 8 bit models (Text) + two-level **16k**-bank mixer hierarchy + master mixer
- SSE/APM/APM2 cascade; cross-block decay 0.995; 32MB LZP window
- BWT text trial (incl. CSV/XML split) + global XWRT-1024 (ESC) + DP-LZP with adaptive thresholds
- Match side-stream: varint + optional order-0 rANS (C9); Binary/Exec 1 MiB + hist
- Classify-ahead Rayon overlap (S10); stretch-on-acc + bank prefetch (S11); wider BWT trial fan-out (S12)
- Enum `StackModel` (V3) instead of `Box<dyn BitModel>`; default `bwt_libsais` (W7)

### Fast Path (`--mode fast`)

- Orders 0-2 count models + **wired** 32-way interleaved byte rANS
- Binary/Exec: hashed order-3 + large o2 tables (W2)
- AVX2 (x86_64) / NEON (aarch64) SIMD walk_dist (scalar fallback + parity tests; CI uses `no_avx2`)
- Global XWRT on Text trials; DP-LZP literal-skip with match side-stream
- Parallel Text/Random block encode (W3)
### Correctness / container hardening (2026-09-11)

- Structured BWT decode (JSON/CSV/XML/XWRT) returns `RcnError` on truncated or invalid payloads (no silent empty `Vec`)
- Global-dict read and decompress payload/`num_blocks` bounds fail closed
- Shared `split_common` framing helpers; unified method↔pipeline maps in `codec`

### Default-mode gate

`--mode hybrid` is default after clearing `zstd -19` on **all** headline files
(2026-09-11 W1–W7 refresh): dickens 26.5%, webster 20.1%, nci 4.99%, mr 27.3%,
json 0.1%. Scorecard: [README.md](README.md#scorecards). Numbers: [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md).

---

## Recommended Next Step

1. **Level `-9`:** keep hybrid default. Close the `mr` dual-axis split vs
   `zstd -19` (need ≤31.2% at ≫1 cmp MB/s — Fast Binary is 31.5% / ~4 MB/s).
2. **Level `-1`:** raise wire LZ ratio toward `zstd -1` and cmp speed toward
   `zstd -1` (parallel tokens, longer chain, SIMD match).
3. **Level `-3`:** beat `gzip -9` on both axes (BWT budget or stronger byte
   models without Slow).

Do **not** re-default Text Indirect, re-open Binary DP ≥24, or re-bump Text PPMd
order without a ≥0.3pt measure. A/B history: [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Levels (L1–L19, 2026-09-12)

| Ticket | Change | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| L1 | Hash-chain LZ wire engine (`METHOD_WIRE` 19); `--level 1` | Landed — dual-axis vs lz4/`zstd -1` still open |
| L3 | Byte CM, no BWT (`METHOD_BYTE_TEXT` 20); `--level 3` | Landed — dual-axis vs gzip-9 still open |
| L9 | Hybrid remains default (`--level 9`) | Landed — both-win vs `-19` on text/`nci`; `mr`/json split |
| L19 | Slow aliased as `--level 19` | Landed |
| D1 | Dual ratio+cmp+both W-L-T in `bench_vs_sota.sh` + README | Landed |

## W1–W7 (2026-09-11)

| Ticket | Change | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| W1 | Binary/Exec block **1 MiB** + cross-block DP-LZP match history (4 MiB cap) | Encoder/decoder keep same-kind hist |
| W2 | Fast Binary/Exec hashed **order-3** + large o2 tables | Text Fast residuals unchanged |
| W3 | Parallel Fast Text/Random block encode (Rayon) | Ordered assemble; Slow stays serial |
| W4 | Global XWRT **1024** words | Was 512 |
| W5 | Binary-only Indirect A/B | **Killed** — mr 27.52% vs prior 27.4% |
| W6 | Kind-specific DP `avg_bits` (Binary/Exec 5.0, else 4.0) | No min-len change |
| W7 | Default `bwt_libsais`; PGO recipe in DEVELOPMENT.md | CI stays non-PGO |

## Hotspot note (2026-09-09)

macOS `sample` on release `rcn` (ARM64, stripped — no demangled frames):

1. **Slow encode:** one deep in-process call chain dominates; consistent with bit CM predict→mix→update. S11 `_mm_prefetch` does not appear as a separable hotspot.
2. **Fast encode:** wall time in transform trial + byte entropy; dickens full file ~seconds at ~26.5% ratio after R2.
3. **Next speed lever (done):** NEON `walk_dist` (V2); BWT winner cache (V1); enum stacks (V3). Profile with `cargo build --profile release-prof`.
